		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This chicken piccata recipe is quick and easy. Pounded chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan
			sauce made
			with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
			<li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
			<li>½ cup white wine</li>
			<li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
			<li>¼ cup water</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken
				breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
			<li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and
				shake
				off any excess.</li>
			<li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and
				cook
				until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
			<li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30
				seconds.
			</li>
			<li>Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom
				of
				the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
			<li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a
				thick
				sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
			<li>Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned
				over
				the top.</li>
