		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most
			popular
			types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.</p>
		<p>There are plenty of delicious ways to season tilapia, but we're partial to the flavors found in this recipe:
			salt,
			pepper, lemon juice, flat-leaf parsley, and fresh thyme. If you want to spice things up a bit, try adding
			garlic
			and/or cayenne pepper. </p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with
				salt
				and pepper.</li>
			<li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.
			</li>
			<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if
				necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
			<li>Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
			<li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme</li>
		</ol>
