	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular
		types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.</p>
	<p>There are plenty of delicious ways to season tilapia, but we're partial to the flavors found in this recipe: salt,
		pepper, lemon juice, flat-leaf parsley, and fresh thyme. If you want to spice things up a bit, try adding garlic
		and/or cayenne pepper. </p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt
			and pepper.</li>
		<li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
		<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if
			necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
		<li>Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
		<li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme</li>
	</ol>
